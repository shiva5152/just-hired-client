              2. Subscription Termination After the First Month

            <div>
              After the first month, users may cancel their subscriptions at any
              time. However, refunds will not be provided for any unused portion
              of the subscription. The subscription will remain active until the
              subscription amount is fully consumed.
            </div>

            <h4 className="mt-10">Subscription Cancellation</h4>
            <div>

              billing cycle unless you cancel it before the renewal date. By
              allowing your subscription to renew, you authorize us to charge
